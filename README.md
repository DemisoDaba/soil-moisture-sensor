# Soil Moisture Sensor

## Overview
This project develops a low-cost soil moisture sensor using Arduino microcontrollers. The goal is to provide an affordable, open-source alternative to expensive commercial sensors for use in agriculture and environmental monitoring.

## Objectives
- Design and build soil moisture sensors with easily available components
- Calibrate and test sensors in field conditions
- Share all hardware schematics, source code, and testing data openly
- Help farmers and researchers in data-scarce regions improve water management

## Features
- Cost-effective and customizable sensor design
- Arduino-based control and data acquisition
- Modular and scalable for multiple sensors

## Components
- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Capacitive soil moisture sensor probes
- Jumper wires, resistors, breadboards
- Optional 3D-printed enclosures for field durability

## Usage
1. Assemble the sensor circuit as per schematics
2. Upload Arduino code to the microcontroller
3. Collect and log soil moisture data
4. Analyze data for irrigation and environmental insights
